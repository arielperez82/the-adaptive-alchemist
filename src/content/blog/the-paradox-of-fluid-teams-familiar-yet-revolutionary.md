April 13th, 1970\. Apollo 13's oxygen tank explodes 200,000 miles from Earth. In Mission Control, the org chart becomes irrelevant. Engineers from different departments huddle around whiteboards. The "Tiger Team" forms organically: pulling expertise from propulsion, life support, navigation, and communications. Titles don't matter. Department budgets are forgotten. The only thing that counts is bringing three astronauts home alive.

Seventy-two hours later, Apollo 13 splashes down safely in the Pacific.

Fast-forward to your last product crisis. A security breach that threatens customer data. A competitor who just launched your exact roadmap six months early. A regulatory change that kills your go-to-market strategy overnight. What happens? The same thing that happened in Mission Control: the org chart gets tossed aside. You pull together the right people, regardless of department or title, and form a team that exists only to solve the problem at hand.

The results are always the same. Decisions get made faster. Expertise flows freely. The impossible starts to look routine.

Here's what's strange: this approach, fluid teams that form, solve problems, and dissolve, has been saving organizations for centuries. Yet most companies treat it as the exception, not the rule. They cling to static teams and rigid reporting lines even as the world demands constant adaptation.

That's the paradox we're exploring: fluid teams are both ancient and revolutionary, proven in the toughest environments yet relegated to emergency use only.

## Fluid teams throughout history

Fluid teams aren't a management consulting invention. They're the default operating model in any field where failure means catastrophe and the environment is unpredictable.

### **Military**: Mission-driven assembly

The Navy SEALs are known for their adaptability and highly specialized skills. While they are organized into squadrons and platoons that train together extensively, mission requirements often dictate a flexible approach to team composition. For a given operation, SEALs may assemble a task-focused unit with experts in areas such as demolitions, communications, medicine, and sniping. This allows the team to be tailored to the unique demands of each mission. After the mission, operators typically return to their regular assignments, ready to be reassembled in new configurations as needed.

For the 2011 raid on Osama bin Laden's compound, SEAL Team Six selected a specialized team that trained intensively for the operation. While the exact composition and prior experience of the team are not fully public, this case highlights the importance of assembling the right personnel for high-stakes missions. After such operations, participants generally return to their standard units.

This flexible approach is not unique to special operations. Even in conventional military units, team composition can change based on the situation, ensuring that the right mix of skills and experience is available for each task.

### **Creative Industries**: Project-Based Excellence

Every film you've watched, from _Avatar_ to _The Avengers_, was made by a crew that came together specifically for that project. A director pulls together cinematographers, editors, sound engineers, and production designers based on the needs of that particular story. When filming wraps, the team dissolves.

Steven Spielberg doesn't maintain a permanent crew of 300 people between films. Instead, he assembles the right team for each project, often working with some familiar faces but always adapting to the specific demands of the story.

Broadway operates the same way. _Hamilton_ brought together composers, choreographers, actors, and designers who had never worked together before. They created something extraordinary, then moved on to other projects with different teams.

### **Science**: Problem-Focused Collaboration

The Human Genome Project mapped our entire genetic code by bringing together biologists, computer scientists, mathematicians, and engineers from dozens of institutions across multiple countries. The team existed only as long as the problem did. When the genome was mapped in 2003, the formal collaboration dissolved, though many relationships and smaller partnerships continued.

More recently, the COVID-19 vaccine development efforts followed a similar pattern. Pharmaceutical companies, universities, and government agencies formed temporary alliances focused on developing vaccines. Teams came together, shared resources, and collaborated intensively. After the initial vaccine development and rollout, many of these formal collaborations wound down, with participants returning to their parent organizations however, some partnerships and ongoing research efforts continued in response to new challenges.

### **Business**: Crisis Mode as the Exception

Even in traditional business, fluid teams emerge during high-stakes moments:

- **Crisis management teams** assemble overnight when data breaches, product recalls, or PR disasters strike
- **Merger and acquisition teams** form specifically to evaluate, negotiate, and integrate deals
- **Skunkworks projects** like those at 3M or Google pull together innovators from across the organization
- **Product launch teams** combine marketing, engineering, sales, and operations for critical releases

The pattern is consistent: when the stakes are highest and the timeline is shortest, organizations abandon their static structures and build teams around the work.

## The Visa Revolution and Dee Hock's Chaordic Organization

The most compelling business example comes from an unlikely source: the credit card industry of the 1960s.

Bank of America's credit card program was in crisis. Fraud was widespread, with losses mounting to millions of dollars each month, equivalent to tens of millions in today's dollars. The technology was unreliable, and frequent system failures made transactions difficult. Merchants increasingly refused to accept the cards, and the brand's reputation was suffering.

Enter Dee Hock, a mid-level bank manager who proposed something radical: a new organizational structure that was neither fully ordered nor chaotic. What he called "[chaordic](https://thesystemsthinker.com/the-nature-and-creation-of-chaordic-organizations/)."

### The Design Breakthrough

Instead of a traditional hierarchy, Hock envisioned a network. Member banks could join or leave freely. They could compete with each other while collaborating on shared infrastructure. There would be no central command, just a set of principles and a shared purpose: enabling global commerce through electronic payments.

The key insight was fluidity by design. Banks could form temporary alliances for specific markets or technologies, then reconfigure as conditions changed. Regional networks could emerge organically. New services could be tested without requiring approval from a central authority.

### The Results

The transformation was stunning:

- **Scale**: Visa grew from 4 million cards in 1970 to over 3 billion cards today
- **Volume**: From $2 billion in annual transactions to over $12 trillion globally
- **Fraud reduction**: Fraud rates dropped from over 2% to under 0.1% through network-wide information sharing
- **Global reach**: Expanded to every country and territory on Earth without a traditional headquarters structure

Most remarkably, Visa achieved this scale while remaining fundamentally fluid. The organization continuously reconfigures itself around new payment technologies, regulatory environments, and market opportunities.

Hock's chaordic model proved that when you design for fluidity from the ground up, you get both adaptability and scale. His insights, captured in [_Birth of the Chaordic Age_](https://amzn.to/3ZgAXx7), remain one of the most compelling examples of fluid organization design.

## Why we keep fluid teams in the "exception" box

If fluid teams work so well in crises, creative projects, and even large-scale business transformation, why do most organizations still treat them as the exception?

### The efficiency trap

For most of the 20th century, business success meant optimizing for predictability and scale. This thinking traces back to [_Taylorism_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_management) and Frederick Winslow Taylor's "scientific management" principles from the early 1900s. Taylor's approach broke work into standardized, repeatable tasks, with clear separation between planning (management) and execution (workers). Every process could be measured, optimized, and controlled.

Henry Ford's assembly line, McDonald's franchise model, and IBM's corporate hierarchy all followed Taylor's blueprint: they prioritized efficiency over adaptability. Fixed teams and clear reporting lines made sense when the work was repetitive and the environment was stable. Taylorism worked brilliantly for manufacturing widgets and serving hamburgers at scale.

This mindset persists even as the environment has fundamentally shifted. Leaders continue to optimize for efficiency in a world that rewards adaptability. The problem isn't that Taylorism was wrong, it's that we're still applying industrial-age solutions to information-age problems.

### Psychological comfort zones

Humans crave clarity and stability. Fixed reporting relationships answer the fundamental questions: "Who's my boss? Who's on my team? What's my role?" Fluid teams feel risky and uncertain, even when they deliver better results.

Research from Harvard Business School shows that people will often choose familiar dysfunction over unfamiliar but more effective approaches. The devil you know feels safer than the angel you don't.

### Structural inertia

Most organizational systems—HR, budgeting, performance management, and career development—are built for static teams:

- **Performance reviews** assume stable team membership and clear individual attribution
- **Budget planning** allocates resources to departments, not dynamic initiatives
- **Career ladders** are tied to specific functions and hierarchical advancement
- **Project management tools** track deliverables, not team formation and dissolution

These systems create powerful incentives to maintain static structures, even when fluid teams would work better.

### The emergency myth

Perhaps most damaging is the belief that fluid teams are only for emergencies or special projects. This creates a two-speed organization: one that adapts brilliantly under pressure, and one that moves slowly the rest of the time.

The myth goes like this: "Fluid teams are great for crises, but we need stability for normal operations." The reality is that in today's environment, there is no "normal." Change is the constant.

## The costs of limiting fluidity to exceptional situations

Treating fluid teams as emergency measures creates measurable organizational debt:

### Context switching tax

When people are pulled into "special projects" while maintaining their regular responsibilities, focus gets diluted. Numerous studies have shown that even brief interruptions can increase task completion, sometimes by up to 25%.

### Knowledge evaporation

Crisis teams that form and dissolve without systematic knowledge capture lose everything they learned. The next crisis starts from scratch, repeating mistakes and rediscovering solutions.

### Competing priorities

"Normal" work and "special" work inevitably conflict. The best people get stretched thin, while critical projects compete for resources and attention.

### Innovation bottlenecks

When fluid teaming is rare, it often gets reserved for the highest-stakes projects. Lower-profile innovations that could benefit from cross-functional collaboration get stuck in departmental silos.

## From exception to operating system

The companies that will thrive in the coming decade won't be those that can briefly assemble fluid teams during crises. They'll be those that make fluidity their default operating model.

The urgency has never been higher. AI agents, assistants, and automation are accelerating this transformation in three critical ways. First, they're eliminating the routine, predictable work that justified static roles and rigid hierarchies. When AI can handle customer service tickets, generate code, and process invoices, human work becomes more creative, strategic, and collaborative by default. Second, AI tools are making fluid team formation dramatically easier. Real-time translation breaks down language barriers, AI-powered matching can identify optimal team compositions across global organizations, and intelligent coordination systems can manage the complexity that once required massive bureaucracies. Third, AI is compressing competitive cycles. When your competitor can prototype, test, and launch new features in days rather than months using AI assistance, your organization's ability to rapidly reconfigure around opportunities becomes a survival skill, not a nice-to-have.

This shift requires more than changing team structures. It means redesigning performance management, rethinking career development, and building new systems for knowledge capture and transfer. It means training leaders to set context rather than assign tasks, and helping people find stability through purpose rather than just position.

### Your next move

Before diving deeper into the series, take a moment to audit your own organization:

- **Where are fluid teams already operating?** Crisis response, special projects, innovation labs?
- **What would happen if you expanded those approaches?** What systems would need to change?
- **What's the cost of your current structure?** How much time and energy goes into coordination rather than creation?

The revolution isn't coming, it's already here. The question is whether you'll be leading it or scrambling to catch up.
