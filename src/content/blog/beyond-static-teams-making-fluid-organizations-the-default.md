## Introduction

March 2020\. A global pandemic shuts down the world economy overnight. Shopify's leadership faced a defining moment: watch their merchants struggle, or rapidly reimagine how their 5,000+ person company operated to help them survive.

They chose transformation. Engineering teams accelerated the development of new merchant survival tools. Marketing pivoted to crisis communication. Sales focused on customer success. Product managers began building features for industries they'd never served before. The traditional org chart became less important than cross-functional collaboration.

The result? While most companies scrambled to adapt, Shopify's gross merchandise volume nearly doubled that year. Their stock price almost tripled. Most remarkably, employee engagement and satisfaction reached all-time highs during the most chaotic period in the company's history.

The lesson wasn't about crisis management. It was about organizational design. When the old structures stopped working, Shopify discovered something powerful: teams that form around problems, not departments, can adapt faster than anyone thought possible.

This isn't a story about pandemic response. It's about why the fundamental architecture of most organizations is broken, and what to do about it.

## Why complicated solutions fail in a complex world

Every executive knows the difference between a hard problem and an impossible one. Building the next iPhone is hard. Predicting which features customers will want in three years is impossible. The first has a clear path to success. The second changes every time you gather new information.

[Dave Snowden's Cynefin framework](https://hbr.org/2007/11/a-leaders-framework-for-decision-making) gives us precise language for this distinction. Complicated problems yield to analysis, expertise, and project management. You can break them into tasks, assign owners, and track progress. Think of launching a satellite or implementing SAP.

Complex problems are different. The solution emerges through experimentation and rapid feedback. Past performance doesn't predict future results. Small changes can have massive impacts. Think of entering a new market, building company culture, or responding to competitive threats.

Most business challenges today are complex, but most organizational structures are built for complicated work. Traditional hierarchies excel at efficiency and control. They struggle with adaptation and learning. When the environment shifts faster than your decision-making process, efficiency becomes a liability.

The companies winning today have learned to match their structure to the problem domain. For complicated work, they use traditional project teams with clear roles and processes. For complex challenges, they build fluid teams that can experiment, learn, and pivot faster than the competition.

## How the military learned to move at the speed of networks

General Stanley McChrystal commanded the world's most elite fighting force, yet he was losing to a ragtag insurgency in Iraq. Al Qaeda in Iraq (AQI) was outmaneuvering a military machine designed for conventional warfare.

The problem wasn't skill or resources. AQI operated as a network: small, autonomous cells that could adapt faster than any command structure could respond. They recruited online, coordinated through encrypted messages, and struck without warning. By the time intelligence filtered up the chain and orders filtered back down, the enemy had already moved.

McChrystal's transformation, documented in [*Team of Teams*](https://amzn.to/3SgypeG), offers the clearest blueprint for organizational adaptation under pressure. Instead of top-down control, he built what he called "shared consciousness": real-time information sharing across all units. Instead of waiting for orders, teams were empowered to act on local intelligence. This approach to [leadership without control](/leadership-without-control-part-1/) became the foundation for military success in complex environments.

The results were dramatic. Mission tempo increased from one operation per month to multiple operations per day. Intelligence cycle time dropped from weeks to hours. Most importantly, they started winning. AQI went from expanding territory to losing ground, and their leader Abu Musab al-Zarqawi was eliminated in a coordinated strike that would have been impossible under the old system.

The military's lesson for business leaders: when you're facing network threats (agile competitors, viral social media campaigns, rapidly changing customer preferences), you need network responses. Hierarchies can't move at the speed of networks.

## The trust equation that changes everything

Most management theory treats people as problems to be solved. Douglas McGregor's famous Theory X assumes people avoid work, resist responsibility, and need constant supervision. Theory Y assumes people find work natural, seek responsibility, and perform best with autonomy and purpose.

Your organizational design broadcasts which theory you believe. Multiple approval layers, detailed job descriptions, and rigid reporting structures all signal Theory X thinking. Open information sharing, flexible roles, and empowered decision-making signal Theory Y.

Research consistently shows Theory Y organizations outperform Theory X on almost every metric: innovation, employee engagement, customer satisfaction, and financial results. Yet most organizations default to Theory X structures because they feel safer and more controllable.

The breakthrough comes when you realize trust isn't just a nice-to-have cultural value. It's an operational necessity. Daniel Pink's research on motivation, detailed in [*Drive*](https://amzn.to/3HoqSYZ), shows that knowledge workers perform best when they have autonomy over their tasks, time, and technique. Micromanagement doesn't just hurt morale. It literally makes people less effective at creative and analytical work.

Fluid organizations build trust through transparency, not control. When people understand the context, constraints, and objectives, they make better decisions than any manager could make for them. When they can see the impact of their work on customers and colleagues, they naturally coordinate without supervision. The key is [building shared consciousness](/shared-consciousness-and-breaking-the-decision-bottleneck/) that enables distributed decision-making at scale.

## Speed and engagement gains from real implementation

Split Software's Experimentation organization faced a classic scaling problem. As the team grew and product complexity increased, innovation slowed to a crawl. Features that used to ship in weeks were taking months. Cross-functional projects died in committee. The best engineers were spending more time in meetings than solving customer problems.

To solve this problem, I turned to FAST (Fluid Adaptive Scaling Technology), an approach that merged separate product and engineering teams into a single unified collective that spawned mission-driven crews on-demand around specific customer problems. Anyone could propose a mission. Anyone could join based on interest and skill.

The mechanics were simple but powerful:

* **Marketplace**: Open process for proposing and staffing new initiatives  
* **Target-driven missions**: Clear target end dates and weekly goals that adjusted as teams learned  
* **Transparent progress tracking**: Real-time visibility into what every team was working on  
* **Rapid retrospectives**: Continuous learning and process improvement

The business impact was measurable and immediate:

* **Release velocity**: Team went from a 17.6% share to a 44.2% share of all product releases,  
* **Team morale transformation**: Team health scores improved from mostly red/yellow to mostly green across all metrics  
* **Operational efficiency**: $100k monthly cost reduction through innovative technology choices  
* **Customer value acceleration**: New features that reduced average activation time from 118 days to 4 days

Perhaps most importantly, people loved it. While there were early detractors and people who opted-out, those who stuck with it couldnâ€™t imagine any other way of working. Engineers learned discovery, product management, leadership, and management while developing deep customer and domain expertise and expanded technical knowledge. Data scientists and product marketers helped refine product decisions across missions. Instead of feeling stuck in their roles, people expanded their capabilities and built relationships across the organization.

The Split experience proves fluid teams aren't just theoretically superior. They deliver better business results while creating more engaging work experiences.

## The new management playbook

Nothing is ever as simple as it first seems. Moving from static to fluid teams requires rethinking fundamental management practices and this is a critical component of the success of any such endeavor.

### Performance management in a fluid world

Traditional performance reviews assume stable teams and clear individual attribution. Fluid teams make both almost impossible. How do you rate someone's individual contribution when success depends on collective effort? How do you compare performance across different missions and time periods?

A possible answer lies in focusing on value creation, not just task completion. Sports analytics offers a better model. Basketball's "[plus-minus](https://www.blazersedge.com/2024/3/31/24117295/nba-plus-minus-portland-trail-blazers-scoot-henderson-record)" statistic measures how much better the team performs when a player is on the court. It captures both individual skill and team contribution in a single metric.

Forward-thinking companies are adopting similar approaches:

* **Team-based metrics**: Measuring collective outcomes rather than individual outputs  
* **Peer feedback systems**: 360-degree input from people who actually worked together  
* **Impact assessment**: Focusing on customer and business results, not activity levels  
* **Growth trajectory tracking**: Measuring skill development and increasing responsibility over time

### Career development without ladders

Traditional career paths assume linear progression up departmental hierarchies. Fluid organizations create growth through expanding capability and increasing impact, not just climbing reporting structures.

Companies like Haier, the Chinese appliance manufacturer, have replaced traditional hierarchies with internal marketplaces. Employees form entrepreneurial teams around business opportunities. Success is measured by customer satisfaction and profit generation. Career advancement comes through building successful businesses, not managing larger teams.

This approach creates more engaged employees and better business results. People pursue opportunities they're passionate about. Skills develop through real challenges, not training programs. Innovation happens organically as teams compete to serve customers better than existing solutions.

## Making the transition without chaos

The shift to fluid teams doesn't happen overnight. Smart organizations start with pilot programs, learn what works, and scale successful practices. Timelines can vary based on organization size. Here's a practical roadmap:

### Phase 1: Assessment and readiness (2-3 months)

* Map current organizational complexity and identify pain points  
* Assess leadership readiness and change capability  
* Select pilot teams and initiatives based on high impact, low risk criteria

### Phase 2: Pilot implementation (3-6 months)

* Launch fluid team pilots with clear success metrics  
* Build supporting systems for information sharing and coordination  
* Train managers in new leadership approaches focused on context-setting

### Phase 3: Scaling what works (6-12 months)

* Expand successful practices to additional teams and departments  
* Update performance management and career development systems  
* Create permanent infrastructure for team formation and dissolution

### Phase 4: Full transformation (12-18 months)

* Make fluid teams the default for complex work  
* Integrate practices into hiring, onboarding, and strategic planning  
* Measure and optimize for continuous improvement

The key is balancing stability with change. People need enough consistency to feel secure while experiencing enough flexibility to stay engaged. The best implementations create stability through purpose and relationships, while allowing structure and roles to evolve with the work.

## Building adaptive capacity for an uncertain future

The world isn't getting more predictable. Technological change, competitive pressure, and customer expectations are accelerating. AI is automating routine work and compressing innovation cycles. Climate change is creating supply chain disruptions. Geopolitical tensions are reshaping global trade.

Organizations built for efficiency in stable environments will struggle to survive in chaotic ones. Those built for adaptation will thrive. The choice isn't between order and chaos. It's between rigid structures that break under pressure and flexible ones that bend without breaking.

Fluid organizations don't just respond to change better. They anticipate it. Teams that form and dissolve regularly develop strong pattern recognition. People who work across functions understand how the business really operates. Leaders who set context rather than micromanage tasks can pivot strategies faster when circumstances shift.

Most importantly, fluid organizations create more resilient and capable people. When your career depends on solving problems rather than defending territory, you develop skills that transfer across industries and economic cycles. When your work involves real collaboration rather than just coordination, you build relationships that last beyond any single job.

The next article in this series will explore the specific principles and patterns that make fluid team design work. For now, the critical question is whether your organization is built for the world as it was, or the world as it's becoming.

Start by identifying where you're already using fluid approaches. Crisis response teams, special projects, and innovation labs all offer glimpses of what's possible. The question isn't whether you can afford to make fluid teams the default. It's whether you can afford not to.
